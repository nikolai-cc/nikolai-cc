I work at the intersection of art, design and technology.

I believe that the ingrediënts to understanding complex concepts are curiosity, exploration, playability and a pinch of humour. That's why at The Ministry of Extraordinary Affairs, I build interactive experiences that ✨spark joy.

I specialise in conceptual design and engineering of interactive products and experiences, blending the digital and physical realms. I work with a range of creative, embedded and front-end technologies.

I work with brands, (creative) industry and education. Interested? Check out http://nikolai.cc and get in touch!
